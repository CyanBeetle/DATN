USE CASE DESCRIPTION - URBAN TRAFFIC MONITORING SYSTEM



Here is the list of 14 main functionalities.
Functional Requirements:

User: End-users who utilize basic functions to monitor, receive information, find routes, interact, and receive support related to traffic.
Admin: System administrators who possess all User permissions plus additional rights to manage foundational data, prediction models, camera devices, and process user feedback.

Authentication and Authorization

UC01: System Login
Description: All users (User and Admin) must log in to access system functions. The system authenticates login information (username/email and password) against the user database. Upon successful authentication, the system will display the appropriate interface and functions corresponding to the user's role (User or Admin).
Note: While the system does not offer a user-facing self-registration interface, user accounts are created and managed via dedicated backend API endpoints (e.g., `/api/auth/register`). This allows for administrative account creation or integration with other provisioning processes.
Common Functions (For both User and Admin)

UC02: View Traffic Map
Description: Display an interactive digital map using Leaflet with a real-time traffic density overlay (heatmap). 
Allows zooming, panning, moving the map. For congestion overlays (heatmap) and route warnings (UC03), the frontend uses a dynamic effect radius around each camera marker. This effect radius is distinct from the camera's ROI (which is used by the backend for vehicle counting only) and its size increases with congestion severity.
Prerequisite: UC01 (System Login).
UC03: Find Route
Description: Allows users to input starting and destination points to find an optimal travel route. Users can input points by typing addresses (with geocoding) or by clicking on the map to place markers. The system uses Leaflet's default client-side routing capabilities to suggest a route. It warns the user if the suggested route passes through the dynamic effect radius of a camera location experiencing congestion level 3 or higher. The effect radius is determined by the frontend based on congestion severity.
Prerequisite: UC02 (View Traffic Map). The user must be on the map interface to activate the route finding function.
UC04: View Real-time Camera
Description: Allows users to select and view live images (video stream) from traffic cameras installed and integrated into the system. The ROI (predetermined coordinates and size) is used for vehicle counting only, not for map overlays.
Prerequisite: UC01 (System Login).
UC05: Manage Favorite Cameras
Description: Allows users to mark one or more cameras as "favorite". The system saves this list for each user. The system will automatically send notifications to the user when traffic density at the location of favorite cameras exceeds a predefined congestion threshold. The ROI is used for vehicle counting; the effect radius is used for map-based alerts.
Prerequisite: UC01 (System Login). User must be able to select a camera (e.g., from a list, map, or stream view) to mark it as favorite.
UC06: View Traffic Forecast
Description: Displays traffic condition forecast information for specific areas (initially a fixed location, potentially expandable). 
Users can select a forecast time horizon (e.g., 15 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 6 hours). 
The system utilizes a pre-trained Keras machine learning model and an associated scaler file (.pkl), specific to the selected time horizon, to generate the forecast. 
Input data for the model is prepared by the backend. The forecast, including predicted congestion levels or traffic speed, is presented to the user, typically as a time-series chart.
Prerequisite: UC01 (System Login).
UC07: View News & Weather
Description: Provides an area displaying the latest urban traffic-related news, announcements from authorities, and weather forecast information for areas of user interest or their current location.
Prerequisite: UC01 (System Login).
UC08: Manage Personal Account
Description: Allows users to view and update basic personal information that is permitted to be changed, e.g., display name, login password.
Prerequisite: UC01 (System Login).
UC09: Submit Report/Feedback
Description: Provides a form allowing users to input information and submit reports about ongoing traffic incidents (accidents, unusual congestion, obstacles...) or feedback about infrastructure issues (broken traffic lights, degraded roads...). Can include location on the map and images (if supported).
Prerequisite: UC01 (System Login).
UC10: Interact with Support Chatbot
Description: Provides a chat interface allowing users (User and Admin) to ask questions or request support regarding application usage, basic traffic information, or common issues. The chatbot will attempt to answer automatically based on its trained knowledge base.
Prerequisite: UC01 (System Login).
Admin-Specific Functions (For Admin Role)
(Admin inherits all Use Cases from UC02 to UC10)

UC11: Access Admin Dashboard
Description: Allows Admin to access a centralized dashboard for system oversight and operational management. This dashboard replaces the previous "Manage Training Data" functionality.
The Admin Dashboard provides access to:
    *   System Health Overview: Display key operational metrics and the status of critical system components (e.g., camera connectivity, API service status).
    *   Camera Management (integrates UC13): View a list of all cameras, add new cameras, edit existing camera details (name, stream URL, ROI, location), change camera status (Active, Inactive, Maintenance), and remove cameras.
    *   Report Management (integrates UC14): View, process, and manage user-submitted reports and feedback.
    *   User Management: View a list of registered users and their roles. (Further user management capabilities like editing roles or status can be considered).
    *   Deployed Forecast Models Overview: List the currently deployed pre-trained forecast models, their versions, associated time horizons (e.g., "15-min-model-v1.2.h5", "1-hour-model-v1.0.keras"), and their status.
    *   (Future Work) Link to Model Performance Metrics Page: A link or section to navigate to a dedicated page displaying detailed performance metrics of the deployed forecast models (as outlined in the proposal for a metrics viewer page).
Prerequisite: UC01 (System Login with Admin role).

UC12: Manage and Monitor Deployed Forecast Model Versions (Repurposed)
Description: (Future Work) Allows Admin to perform detailed lifecycle management and operational monitoring of the deployed pre-trained forecast models. This complements the overview that might exist in UC11 (Admin Dashboard) and provides a dedicated interface for model version control and basic monitoring.
Key Functions (Proposed for Future Work):
    1.  Version Management:
        *   View all uploaded model versions for each specific time horizon (e.g., 15-min, 1-hour, 2-hour, 6-hour).
        *   Set a specific uploaded model version as the "active" one for making predictions for its designated time horizon.
    2.  Detailed Metadata Viewing/Editing:
        *   Access and manage extended metadata for each model file (e.g., upload date, file size, associated scaler, version notes, link to training documentation/metrics).
    3.  Operational Monitoring (Read-Only):
        *   Display basic operational statistics for active model versions (e.g., last prediction timestamp, prediction count, error occurrences).
    4.  (Optional) Archiving/Deleting Old Versions:
        *   Functionality to archive or delete old, inactive model versions.
    5.  (Future Work) Model Performance Metrics Viewer:
        *   Display detailed performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, R2 score, step-wise performance) for each deployed model version, loaded from a metrics file (e.g., `trained_models.pkl`). This could be integrated here or as a separate linked page.
Prerequisite: UC01 (System Login with Admin role).

UC13: Manage Camera Status
Description: Allows Admin to view a list of cameras currently managed in the system. Admin can change the status of a camera (e.g., enable/disable display for users, mark for maintenance) or completely remove a camera from the system (e.g., when a device is faulty or relocated).
Prerequisite: UC01 (System Login with Admin role).

UC14: Process Reports/Feedback
Description: Displays a list of reports/feedback submitted by users (from UC09). Admin can view the details of each report, verify information. Based on the verification result, Admin can:
Mark the report as "Verified" (can include automatic or custom reply message to the submitter).
Mark the report as "Invalid" or "Rejected".
Update processing status (e.g., "Processing", "Resolved").
Processed reports will be stored according to regulations or deleted if needed.
Prerequisite: UC01 (System Login with Admin role).
